# Getting started with Digital VLSI SOC Design and Planning

## Understand the application and write a C program accordingly

## After writing the c program specifications write a verilog code

## Periferal and processor are the two things in verilog code

## The processor design can be done using gate level synthesis. Periferals can be designed by using the macros and analog IP's

## These all are combined and are connected to design a SOC througn GPIO's

## these SOC GPIO are checked with with verilog design and with the required application so they are all in same working model

## In the SOC we connect the processer and the required peripherals using the floor planing, routing, cts and placement

## this design is then converted to GDSII format so it can be readable by the manufacturer and after it undergoes testing IC is fabricated

## After IC is design it is tested using test board which is designed for this specific application with the help of application software and the fermwareand tested

## After testing it will be used according to the application in the required boards like ardino boards, watches, etc
